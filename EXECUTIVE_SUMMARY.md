# Executive Summary: Current State & Next Steps

**Session:** 8 Complete  
**Date:** January 29, 2025  
**Status:** 🟢 RAG System Operational, Ready for Testing

---

## 🎯 Current State

### ✅ What's Working

**RAG System (NEW!):**
- Dedicated RAG Search dashboard card and page
- Semantic search using OpenAI embeddings
- Claude synthesis for intelligent answers
- One-click "Index for RAG" button
- Duplicate prevention and audit trail
- Video jump links via segment markers

**Transcription Editor:**
- Side-by-side timestamped editing (T-1 original | editable segments)
- Visual indicators (orange badges on edited segments)
- Navigation to jump between edited segments only
- 80vh editor window for better UX
- Proper version ordering (H-3 → H-2 → H-1 → T-1)

**Edit Tracking:**
- Accurate tracking (only records actual user changes)
- No false positives (fixed 427 error bug)
- UI-based detection (replaced broken diff algorithm)
- Corrections dashboard functional

**Data & Search:**
- Complete storage documentation
- All tables and relationships mapped
- Exact text search (dedicated to Text Search)
- Semantic search (dedicated to RAG Search)

## 🚀 Immediate Next Steps (Pick One)

### Option A: Test RAG System (RECOMMENDED) 🔴
**Goal:** Verify RAG indexing and search work with real queries  
**Time:** 1-2 hours  
**Tasks:**
1. Go to a Final Version in a transcription
2. Click "🚀 Send to Insight" (if not done)
3. Click "🤖 Index for RAG" button
4. Navigate to RAG Search dashboard
5. Enter natural language query
6. Test semantic search results
7. Try Claude synthesis

**Why:** Ensure the new RAG system works end-to-end

### Option B: Continue Features 🟡
**Goal:** Expand functionality  
**Tasks:**
- Add keyboard shortcuts for transcription editor
- Implement auto-save drafts
- Add undo/redo
- Batch editing improvements
- Video player integration for RAG

**Why:** Build out the platform

## 📋 The Simple Answer

**What to do next?**

👉 **TEST THE RAG SYSTEM** ← Recommended

Follow the workflow:
1. Edit & Finalize transcript → Promote to Final
2. Send to Insight → Extract metadata
3. Index for RAG → Generate chunks + embeddings
4. Search via RAG → Semantic queries

If it works: You have AI-powered knowledge base search! 🎉

If there are issues: Document them and we'll fix them.
