## 📋 The Simple Answer

**What to do next?**

👉 **TEST THE NEW EDITOR** ← Recommended

Open the app, go to a transcription, click edit, make some changes, and verify:
- Orange badges appear
- Navigation works
- Saving is accurate

If it all works: **Run the H-6 cleanup migration** to delete the 427 false corrections.

If there are issues: Document them and we'll fix them.

## 📚 Key Documents Created

1. **`DATA_STORAGE_COMPREHENSIVE.md`** - Where everything is stored
2. **`NEXT_STEPS.md`** - Detailed action items
3. **`CODE_CLEANUP.md`** - What was purged
4. **`Sessions.md`** - Updated with Session 7

---

## ⚠️ One Action Item

**Run this SQL in Supabase:**
```sql
-- File: sql/migrations/supabase-purge-h6-entries.sql
DELETE FROM max_transcription_versions WHERE version_type = 'H-6';
```

**Why:** Removes the 427 false corrections that caused issues.
