## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)

### 1. **Test the New Editor with Real Data** 🔴 HIGH
**Goal:** Verify the new editing system works with actual transcriptions

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Open existing transcription with edits
- [ ] Test side-by-side editing interface
- [ ] Verify orange badges appear on edited segments
- [ ] Test "Prev/Next" navigation between edits
- [ ] Save a new version and verify only actual edits recorded
- [ ] Check corrections dashboard to confirm accuracy

**Expected Outcome:** Smooth editing experience, accurate edit tracking

---

### 2. **Run H-6 Cleanup Migration** 🔴 HIGH
**Goal:** Remove the 427 false corrections from database

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Open Supabase SQL Editor
- [ ] Run: `sql/migrations/supabase-purge-h6-entries.sql`
- [ ] Verify query returns: `remaining_h6_versions = 0`
- [ ] Check corrections dashboard is clean

**Expected Outcome:** H-6 version deleted, false corrections removed

---

### 3. **Add Keyboard Shortcuts** 🟡 MEDIUM
**Goal:** Make navigation faster for power users

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Add `Ctrl/Cmd + →` for next edited segment
- [ ] Add `Ctrl/Cmd + ←` for previous edited segment
- [ ] Add `Ctrl/Cmd + S` to save version
- [ ] Show keyboard shortcuts in UI tooltip

**Expected Outcome:** Faster editing workflow

---

### 4. **Consider Undo/Redo** 🟢 LOW
**Goal:** Add safety net for accidental edits

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Analyze if needed (autosave exists)
- [ ] Design undo stack architecture
- [ ] Implement if user wants it

**Expected Outcome:** Optional undo functionality

---

## 📋 Future Enhancements (Not Urgent)

### Transcription Editor
- [ ] Auto-save while editing (draft state)
- [ ] Batch editing (apply same correction to multiple instances)
- [ ] Copy/paste between segments
- [ ] Find/replace within segment

### Corrections System
- [ ] Implement Phase 2: Smart Suggestions
- [ ] Implement Phase 3: Auto-Correct
- [ ] Build corrections admin panel
- [ ] Export corrections as CSV

### UI/UX
- [ ] Dark mode (system preference detection)
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts modal
- [ ] Progress indicators
- [ ] Toast notifications instead of alerts

### Performance
- [ ] Lazy load long transcripts
- [ ] Virtual scrolling for 100+ segments
- [ ] Optimize database queries
- [ ] Add caching layer

---

## 🚨 Known Issues (Monitor)

1. **Edit Detection Edge Cases**
   - Test with special characters
   - Test with very long segments
   - Test with multiple edits in one segment

2. **Version Display**
   - Verify final version syntax is correct
   - Test with 10+ versions
   - Check expand/collapse performance

---

## 📚 Documentation Status

### ✅ Complete
- `Sessions.md` - Session 7 documented
- `DATA_STORAGE_COMPREHENSIVE.md` - Complete data mapping
- `CODE_CLEANUP.md` - Cleanup analysis
- `edit-tracking-system.md` - System design

### ⚠️ Needs Update
- `roadmap.md` - Current phase status outdated
- `database.md` - May need new columns added

---

## 🎯 Recommended Work Flow for Next Session

### If Testing (Session 8 - Recommended)
1. Open app and navigate to existing transcription
2. Click "Edit" on latest version
3. Make a few edits and verify orange badges
4. Use Prev/Next to navigate
5. Save version and check corrections
6. Run H-6 cleanup migration
7. Document any issues found

**Time:** 1-2 hours

### If Adding Features (Session 8 - Alternative)
1. Implement keyboard shortcuts
2. Add tooltip showing shortcuts
3. Test thoroughly
4. Push to GitHub

**Time:** 2-3 hours

---

## 💡 Key Decisions Needed

### Short Term
1. **Do you want keyboard shortcuts?** (Recommended: Yes)
2. **Do you want undo/redo?** (Recommended: Not urgent)
3. **Auto-save drafts?** (Recommended: Yes, for safety)

### Long Term
1. **When to implement smart suggestions?** (After 50+ edits)
2. **Confidence score threshold for auto-correct?** (10+ confirmations)
3. **Voice cloning priority?** (After core features solid)
