## Previous Session: Session 1

**Date:** October 25-26, 2025  
**Duration:** Documentation Restructuring  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### What I Worked On
- Reviewed all existing documentation (8+ files)
- Analyzed structure and redundancy issues
- Reorganized entire documentation structure
- Created clean folder hierarchy
- Implemented Sessions.md for tracking coding accomplishments

### Completed
- ✅ Created `docs/` folder structure (technical/ and planning/)
- ✅ Created `Sessions.md` (this file) - Primary session tracking
- ✅ Created `README.md` - Main entry point with overview
- ✅ Created `INDEX.md` - Quick navigation to all docs
- ✅ Created `docs/planning/roadmap.md` - 4-week timeline
- ✅ Moved technical docs to `docs/technical/`:
  - architecture.md (system design)
  - database.md (13 tables schema)
  - api-routes.md (endpoint reference)
  - setup.md (30-min setup guide)
  - project-structure.md (file organization)
  - specifications.md (technical requirements)
- ✅ Moved planning docs to `docs/planning/`:
  - prd.md (product requirements)
  - roadmap.md (development timeline)
  - tasks.md (detailed tasks)
- ✅ Deleted redundant files (START-HERE, MANIFEST, claude-chat-notes, etc.)
- ✅ Cleaned up project root directory

### Blockers
None - all objectives completed

### Next Up
- [ ] Begin Phase 1 development (Foundation)
- [ ] Set up local environment
- [ ] Create Supabase project
- [ ] Start implementing authentication
- [ ] Use Sessions.md to track each coding session

### Session Notes
- **Key insight:** User specifically requested Sessions.md to track coding accomplishments
- **Structure:** Root level has README.md, INDEX.md, Sessions.md for visibility
- **Organization:** Technical docs in docs/technical/, planning in docs/planning/
- **Navigation:** INDEX.md provides quick lookup by topic
- **Redundancy removed:** 5+ duplicate/redundant files deleted
- **Clean structure:** 3 root files + 9 organized docs

### Files Changed
- Created: README.md, INDEX.md, Sessions.md, docs/planning/roadmap.md
- Moved: 6 technical docs to docs/technical/
- Moved: 3 planning docs to docs/planning/
- Deleted: START-HERE.md, MAX-DOCUMENTATION-INDEX.md, MAX-SETUP-GUIDE.md, claude.md, claude-chat-notes.md, delete/ folder, readme.md.txt

### Key Decisions
1. **Sessions.md** is primary session tracking (not tasks.md) - user request
2. **Root directory** for Sessions.md for easy access (user emphasized this)
3. **Technical vs Planning** separation for clear organization
4. **INDEX.md** for fast navigation instead of multiple entry points
5. **Consolidated README** instead of START-HERE/MANIFEST/QUICK-REFERENCE

- Fixed speech file persistence across page reloads

### Completed
- ✅ Added Japanese (🇯🇵) and Hindi (🇮🇳) to translation system
- ✅ Updated translation API routes with new language codes
- ✅ Updated voice mappings for Japanese and Hindi
- ✅ Implemented batch translation button (translates all 9 languages sequentially)
- ✅ Fixed speech file loading on page reload
- ✅ Added proper JavaScript download handler for speech files
- ✅ Set all voices to female across all 9 languages
- ✅ Fixed translation versioning to auto-delete old speech when new version is saved
- ✅ Auto-promote new translation versions to final
- ✅ Cleaned up temporary documentation files in root folder

### Voice Configuration (All Female)
- 🇪🇸 **Spanish:** Serena (`ThT5KcBeYPX3keUQqHPh`)
- 🇵🇹 **Portuguese:** Bella (`EXAVITQu4vr4xnSDxMaL`)
- 🇸🇦 **Arabic:** Bella
- 🇫🇷 **French:** Bella
- 🇩🇪 **German:** Bella
- 🇮🇹 **Italian:** Elli (`MF3mGyEYCl7XYWbV9V6O`)
- 🇨🇳 **Mandarin:** Gigi (`LcfcDJNUP1GQjkzn1xUU`)
- 🇯🇵 **Japanese:** Domi (`AZnzlk1XvdvUeBnXmlld`)
- 🇮🇳 **Hindi:** Bella

### Implementation Details
- **Translation Workflow:** Matches transcription workflow - saves versions (H-1, H-2), auto-promotes to final, deletes old speech
- **Speech Generation:** Uses ElevenLabs with 500 char limit for testing (approximately 30 seconds)
- **Download Handling:** JavaScript blob download for cross-origin Supabase URLs
- **Batch Translation:** Sequentially translates all 9 languages with 500ms delay between requests
- **Speech Persistence:** Speech files load automatically when translations are loaded on page refresh

### Files Modified
- `src/app/api/transcriptions/[id]/translate/route.ts` - Added Japanese & Hindi
- `src/lib/prompts/translation.ts` - Added language mappings
- `src/app/api/speech/generate/route.ts` - Added voice mappings, all female voices
- `src/components/audio/TranscriptionView.tsx` - Added batch translate button, download handler, speech loading
- `src/app/api/translations/[id]/versions/route.ts` - Auto-delete old speech, auto-promote to final
- Cleaned up temporary files: `fix-storage-simple.md`, `reset-password-link.md`, `SETUP-COMPLETE.md`
- Moved `database-setup-instructions.md` → `docs/technical/database-setup.md`

### Key Technical Decisions
1. **All Female Voices:** Selected for consistency and professional sound
2. **Bella for Multiple Languages:** Used ElevenLabs multilingual voice for Portuguese, Arabic, French, Hindi
3. **Speech Regeneration:** Auto-deletes old speech when translation is edited to prevent duplicates
4. **Batch Translation:** Single button to generate all 9 languages (saves time)
5. **500 Character Limit:** Protects ElevenLabs token usage during testing
6. **Download Handler:** JavaScript blob approach works for all browsers with cross-origin URLs

### Test Results
- ✅ Translation generates successfully for all 9 languages
- ✅ Batch translation works (translates all languages sequentially)
- ✅ Speech generation works (Japanese tested, ~8 seconds for 500 chars)
- ✅ Speech files persist across page reloads
- ✅ Download functionality works (JavaScript blob download)
- ✅ No duplicate speech files after editing translations

### Next Up
- [ ] Test remaining 8 languages for speech generation
- [ ] Increase speech length limit when ready for production
- [ ] Add voice cloning feature (instant and professional)
- [ ] Implement translation quality improvements (dictionary terms)
- [ ] Add more languages as needed

### Session Notes
- **Translation Quality:** Claude generates good translations with proper medical terminology preservation
- **Speech Quality:** ElevenLabs multilingual voices work well across languages
- **Workflow:** Translation → Edit → Save → Auto-regenerate speech matches transcription pattern
- **Testing:** Limited to 500 chars to minimize ElevenLabs usage during development
- **Dubbing Decision:** Implemented Option A (continuous audio generation). Cost: ~$0.15 per language (~$1.35 for all 9), Time: 60-90 seconds, Manual alignment in video editor (industry-standard workflow). Option B deferred to future (segment-by-segment with automatic alignment): ~$200 per video, 30-45 minutes, but perfect timestamp sync.

- ✅ Implemented side-by-side editor (T-1 original on left, editable on right)
- ✅ Added visual indicators for edited segments (orange badge "✓ Edited")
- ✅ Built navigation system to jump between edited segments only
- ✅ Fixed edit detection to only track actual user changes (not false positives)
- ✅ Increased editor window height from 384px to 80vh for better navigation
- ✅ Fixed version ordering (latest H versions first, T-1 at bottom)
- ✅ Fixed expand/collapse arrows for all versions
- ✅ Removed "Hide/Show Dubbing Script Format" button
- ✅ Updated display mode to show segments with timestamps
- ✅ Disabled broken diff generation algorithm (was creating 427 false corrections)
- ✅ Implemented proper edit tracking that only records actual segment changes

### Files Modified
- **Major Refactor:**
  - `src/components/audio/TranscriptionView.tsx` - Complete timestamped editor redesign
  - `src/app/api/transcriptions/[id]/versions/route.ts` - Fixed edit tracking logic
  - `src/app/api/transcriptions/[id]/versions/route.ts` - Use actual_edits from UI
  
### Key Technical Changes

**Edit Tracking Fix:**
- **Problem:** Diff algorithm created cascading false positives (427 corrections!)
- **Root Cause:** Simple word-by-word comparison couldn't handle insertions/deletions
- **Solution:** Changed to track only segments user explicitly edited in the UI
- **Result:** Only records actual edits made during the session

**Side-by-Side Editor:**
- **Left Panel:** Read-only T-1 original segments with timestamps
- **Right Panel:** Editable segments with individual textareas
- **Features:** 
  - Orange "✓ Edited" badge on changed segments
  - Navigation buttons to jump between edited segments
  - Yellow highlight on currently focused edited segment
  - 80vh height for better long-transcript navigation
  - Real-time edit count display

**Version Display:**
- **Order:** H-3 (latest) → H-2 → H-1 → T-1 (oldest)
- **Expand/Collapse:** Fixed button type to prevent form submission issues
- **Display:** Shows segments with timestamps when available

### Follow-Up
- **Critical Bug Fix:** Disabled diff generation algorithm that was creating 427 false corrections from H-6
- **User Feedback:** "WOAH - the system went crazy and made 427 corrections that I did not approve!!!!"
- **Solution:** Track only user's explicit edits via UI tracking, not text-based diff

### Git Commits (Not yet committed - pending user approval)

### Session Notes
- **UX Improvement:** Much easier to navigate long transcripts with jump-to-edited functionality
- **Edit Tracking:** Now accurately records only what the user actually changes
- **Visual Feedback:** Clear orange indicators show which segments have been modified
- **Editor Height:** 80vh provides significantly more screen space for editing
- **False Positive Fix:** Completely eliminated the problematic diff algorithm
- **SQL Migration Created:** `sql/migrations/supabase-purge-h6-entries.sql` to remove false corrections

---

## Next Steps: Transcription Editor & System Improvements

**Focus:** Continue refining transcription editing workflow and system stability

### Completed Foundation
- ✅ Timestamped editing implemented as source of truth
- ✅ Edit tracking now accurately records only explicit user changes
- ✅ Side-by-side editor with visual indicators
- ✅ Navigation between edited segments
- ✅ Version ordering and expand/collapse working correctly

### Still To Do
- [ ] Test the edit tracking with real transcriptions
- [ ] Consider adding undo/redo functionality for edits
- [ ] Potential keyboard shortcuts for navigation (Ctrl+→ for next edit, etc.)
- [ ] Continue monitoring for any edge cases in edit detection

### System Architecture

**What's Already Stored:**
- ✅ MP3 file: `max_audio_files.file_path` (Supabase Storage)
- ✅ Final transcript version: `max_transcriptions.final_version_id` → `max_transcription_versions`
- ✅ Complete transcription: `max_transcription_versions.edited_text`
- ✅ Timestamped dubbed version: `max_translation_versions.json_with_timestamps`
- ✅ Original Whisper transcription: `max_transcriptions.raw_text` (T-1)
- ⚠️ Edited words tracking: Currently only for translations, not English transcriptions

**What's Being Added:**
- New table: `max_transcription_correction_patterns` - Global dictionary of corrections
- New column: `max_transcription_versions.dictionary_corrections_applied` - Word-level edit tracking

### Key Features

1. **Word-Level Edit Tracking:** Every edit stores original → corrected text with position
2. **Pattern Learning:** System learns from edits and builds confidence scores
3. **Future Automation:** When confidence is high enough, auto-apply corrections
4. **Audit Trail:** Complete history of what was changed and why

### Files Created
- `sql/migrations/supabase-add-translation-edit-tracking.sql` - Database schema
- `docs/technical/edit-tracking-system.md` - Technical documentation

### Final Version Display Syntax
- **Format:** `FV-[H version]-[file identifier]`
- **Examples:**
  - `FV-H-1-intro-to-isa` (using simplified filename)
  - `FV-H-3-whyisa001` (using existing identifier)
  - `FV-H-2-whyisa001_en_source` (using full filename without extension)
- **Computer-friendly:** Use file identifier, not long display names

### Development Phases (Planned)

**Phase 1: Capture & Display (Initial)**
- Automatically track edits when user saves transcription versions
- Show corrections in read-only dashboard (Audio File, Original Word, Your Edit, Context, Final Version badge)
- Context: 2 words before + 2 words after each edit

**Phase 2: Corrections Dashboard (After ~12 Final Versions)**
- Dictionary view aggregating all Original → Corrected patterns
- Show frequency/confidence scores
- Allow merging duplicates, cleaning noisy entries

**Phase 3: Smart Suggestions (Future)**
- Inline suggestions for new transcriptions based on learned patterns
- User accepts/rejects suggestions (affects confidence scores)

**Phase 4: Auto-Apply (Future)**
- When confidence threshold met, auto-correct with batch review
- User can enable/disable auto-correction

### Next Steps (Not Implemented Yet)
1. Implement diff generation when saving edited transcriptions
2. Create pattern extraction logic
3. Build suggestion engine for future transcriptions
4. Add UI for reviewing/accepting auto-corrections
