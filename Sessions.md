## Previous Session: Session 1

**Date:** October 25-26, 2025  
**Duration:** Documentation Restructuring  
**Status:** âœ… Complete

### What I Worked On
- Reviewed all existing documentation (8+ files)
- Analyzed structure and redundancy issues
- Reorganized entire documentation structure
- Created clean folder hierarchy
- Implemented Sessions.md for tracking coding accomplishments

### Completed
- âœ… Created `docs/` folder structure (technical/ and planning/)
- âœ… Created `Sessions.md` (this file) - Primary session tracking
- âœ… Created `README.md` - Main entry point with overview
- âœ… Created `INDEX.md` - Quick navigation to all docs
- âœ… Created `docs/planning/roadmap.md` - 4-week timeline
- âœ… Moved technical docs to `docs/technical/`:
  - architecture.md (system design)
  - database.md (13 tables schema)
  - api-routes.md (endpoint reference)
  - setup.md (30-min setup guide)
  - project-structure.md (file organization)
  - specifications.md (technical requirements)
- âœ… Moved planning docs to `docs/planning/`:
  - prd.md (product requirements)
  - roadmap.md (development timeline)
  - tasks.md (detailed tasks)
- âœ… Deleted redundant files (START-HERE, MANIFEST, claude-chat-notes, etc.)
- âœ… Cleaned up project root directory

### Blockers
None - all objectives completed

### Next Up
- [ ] Begin Phase 1 development (Foundation)
- [ ] Set up local environment
- [ ] Create Supabase project
- [ ] Start implementing authentication
- [ ] Use Sessions.md to track each coding session

### Session Notes
- **Key insight:** User specifically requested Sessions.md to track coding accomplishments
- **Structure:** Root level has README.md, INDEX.md, Sessions.md for visibility
- **Organization:** Technical docs in docs/technical/, planning in docs/planning/
- **Navigation:** INDEX.md provides quick lookup by topic
- **Redundancy removed:** 5+ duplicate/redundant files deleted
- **Clean structure:** 3 root files + 9 organized docs

### Files Changed
- Created: README.md, INDEX.md, Sessions.md, docs/planning/roadmap.md
- Moved: 6 technical docs to docs/technical/
- Moved: 3 planning docs to docs/planning/
- Deleted: START-HERE.md, MAX-DOCUMENTATION-INDEX.md, MAX-SETUP-GUIDE.md, claude.md, claude-chat-notes.md, delete/ folder, readme.md.txt

### Key Decisions
1. **Sessions.md** is primary session tracking (not tasks.md) - user request
2. **Root directory** for Sessions.md for easy access (user emphasized this)
3. **Technical vs Planning** separation for clear organization
4. **INDEX.md** for fast navigation instead of multiple entry points
5. **Consolidated README** instead of START-HERE/MANIFEST/QUICK-REFERENCE

## Current Session: Session 3 - Translation & Speech Generation

**Date:** October 27, 2025  
**Duration:** ~6 hours  
**Status:** âœ… Complete  
**Focus:** Translation workflow with 9 languages + Speech generation with ElevenLabs

### What I Worked On
- Added Japanese and Hindi to the translation system (now supports 9 languages)
- Implemented batch translation button for all 9 languages
- Fixed translation versioning workflow (no duplicate human edits)
- Implemented speech generation with ElevenLabs
- Added proper download functionality for generated speech
- Set up all female voices for 9 languages
- Fixed speech file persistence across page reloads

### Completed
- âœ… Added Japanese (ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ) and Hindi (ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³) to translation system
- âœ… Updated translation API routes with new language codes
- âœ… Updated voice mappings for Japanese and Hindi
- âœ… Implemented batch translation button (translates all 9 languages sequentially)
- âœ… Fixed speech file loading on page reload
- âœ… Added proper JavaScript download handler for speech files
- âœ… Set all voices to female across all 9 languages
- âœ… Fixed translation versioning to auto-delete old speech when new version is saved
- âœ… Auto-promote new translation versions to final
- âœ… Cleaned up temporary documentation files in root folder

### Voice Configuration (All Female)
- ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ **Spanish:** Serena (`ThT5KcBeYPX3keUQqHPh`)
- ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹ **Portuguese:** Bella (`EXAVITQu4vr4xnSDxMaL`)
- ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¦ **Arabic:** Bella
- ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· **French:** Bella
- ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª **German:** Bella
- ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ **Italian:** Elli (`MF3mGyEYCl7XYWbV9V6O`)
- ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³ **Mandarin:** Gigi (`LcfcDJNUP1GQjkzn1xUU`)
- ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ **Japanese:** Domi (`AZnzlk1XvdvUeBnXmlld`)
- ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ **Hindi:** Bella

### Implementation Details
- **Translation Workflow:** Matches transcription workflow - saves versions (H-1, H-2), auto-promotes to final, deletes old speech
- **Speech Generation:** Uses ElevenLabs with 500 char limit for testing (approximately 30 seconds)
- **Download Handling:** JavaScript blob download for cross-origin Supabase URLs
- **Batch Translation:** Sequentially translates all 9 languages with 500ms delay between requests
- **Speech Persistence:** Speech files load automatically when translations are loaded on page refresh

### Files Modified
- `src/app/api/transcriptions/[id]/translate/route.ts` - Added Japanese & Hindi
- `src/lib/prompts/translation.ts` - Added language mappings
- `src/app/api/speech/generate/route.ts` - Added voice mappings, all female voices
- `src/components/audio/TranscriptionView.tsx` - Added batch translate button, download handler, speech loading
- `src/app/api/translations/[id]/versions/route.ts` - Auto-delete old speech, auto-promote to final
- Cleaned up temporary files: `fix-storage-simple.md`, `reset-password-link.md`, `SETUP-COMPLETE.md`
- Moved `database-setup-instructions.md` â†’ `docs/technical/database-setup.md`

### Key Technical Decisions
1. **All Female Voices:** Selected for consistency and professional sound
2. **Bella for Multiple Languages:** Used ElevenLabs multilingual voice for Portuguese, Arabic, French, Hindi
3. **Speech Regeneration:** Auto-deletes old speech when translation is edited to prevent duplicates
4. **Batch Translation:** Single button to generate all 9 languages (saves time)
5. **500 Character Limit:** Protects ElevenLabs token usage during testing
6. **Download Handler:** JavaScript blob approach works for all browsers with cross-origin URLs

### Test Results
- âœ… Translation generates successfully for all 9 languages
- âœ… Batch translation works (translates all languages sequentially)
- âœ… Speech generation works (Japanese tested, ~8 seconds for 500 chars)
- âœ… Speech files persist across page reloads
- âœ… Download functionality works (JavaScript blob download)
- âœ… No duplicate speech files after editing translations

### Next Up
- [ ] Test remaining 8 languages for speech generation
- [ ] Increase speech length limit when ready for production
- [ ] Add voice cloning feature (instant and professional)
- [ ] Implement translation quality improvements (dictionary terms)
- [ ] Add more languages as needed

### Session Notes
- **Translation Quality:** Claude generates good translations with proper medical terminology preservation
- **Speech Quality:** ElevenLabs multilingual voices work well across languages
- **Workflow:** Translation â†’ Edit â†’ Save â†’ Auto-regenerate speech matches transcription pattern
- **Testing:** Limited to 500 chars to minimize ElevenLabs usage during development
- **Dubbing Decision:** Implemented Option A (continuous audio generation). Cost: ~$0.15 per language (~$1.35 for all 9), Time: 60-90 seconds, Manual alignment in video editor (industry-standard workflow). Option B deferred to future (segment-by-segment with automatic alignment): ~$200 per video, 30-45 minutes, but perfect timestamp sync.

- Updated project modal UI (title, labels, removed "Other" option)
- Added "Create New Project Type" functionality
- Updated project types: ISA â†’ KE Track - Invisalign Smile Architect, added KE Track - Team
- Fixed RLS policy for transcriptions to prevent 42501 errors

### Completed
- âœ… Fixed batch button logic to only show when data is fully loaded (prevents flashing)
- âœ… Added `translationsLoaded` and `speechLoaded` state tracking
- âœ… Updated modal title from "Upload Audio" â†’ "Select a project"
- âœ… Updated label from "Project to Upload To" â†’ "Project Category"

- `sql/migrations/supabase-update-project-types.sql` - Migration for existing databases
- `sql/migrations/supabase-fix-transcription-rls.sql` - RLS policy fix

### Key Technical Decisions
1. **Batch Button Logic:** Only show when data is fully loaded to prevent UI flashing
2. **Project Type Management:** Users can create custom project types on-the-fly instead of being limited to "Other"
3. **RLS Fix:** Added proper ownership validation in INSERT policy to prevent security issues

### Session Notes
- **UI/UX:** Batch buttons now properly handle partial completion state (e.g., 3 of 9 languages translated)
- **Naming:** Cleaned up project type naming to be more specific (KE Track instead of ISA)
- **Database:** Migration files created for easy deployment to production
- **Security:** Fixed RLS policy that was too permissive, now properly validates ownership
