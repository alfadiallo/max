## Previous Session: Session 1

**Date:** October 25-26, 2025  
**Duration:** Documentation Restructuring  
**Status:** âœ… Complete

### What I Worked On
- Reviewed all existing documentation (8+ files)
- Analyzed structure and redundancy issues
- Reorganized entire documentation structure
- Created clean folder hierarchy
- Implemented Sessions.md for tracking coding accomplishments

### Completed
- âœ… Created `docs/` folder structure (technical/ and planning/)
- âœ… Created `Sessions.md` (this file) - Primary session tracking
- âœ… Created `README.md` - Main entry point with overview
- âœ… Created `INDEX.md` - Quick navigation to all docs
- âœ… Created `docs/planning/roadmap.md` - 4-week timeline
- âœ… Moved technical docs to `docs/technical/`:
  - architecture.md (system design)
  - database.md (13 tables schema)
  - api-routes.md (endpoint reference)
  - setup.md (30-min setup guide)
  - project-structure.md (file organization)
  - specifications.md (technical requirements)
- âœ… Moved planning docs to `docs/planning/`:
  - prd.md (product requirements)
  - roadmap.md (development timeline)
  - tasks.md (detailed tasks)
- âœ… Deleted redundant files (START-HERE, MANIFEST, claude-chat-notes, etc.)
- âœ… Cleaned up project root directory

### Blockers
None - all objectives completed

### Next Up
- [ ] Begin Phase 1 development (Foundation)
- [ ] Set up local environment
- [ ] Create Supabase project
- [ ] Start implementing authentication
- [ ] Use Sessions.md to track each coding session

### Session Notes
- **Key insight:** User specifically requested Sessions.md to track coding accomplishments
- **Structure:** Root level has README.md, INDEX.md, Sessions.md for visibility
- **Organization:** Technical docs in docs/technical/, planning in docs/planning/
- **Navigation:** INDEX.md provides quick lookup by topic
- **Redundancy removed:** 5+ duplicate/redundant files deleted
- **Clean structure:** 3 root files + 9 organized docs

### Files Changed
- Created: README.md, INDEX.md, Sessions.md, docs/planning/roadmap.md
- Moved: 6 technical docs to docs/technical/
- Moved: 3 planning docs to docs/planning/
- Deleted: START-HERE.md, MAX-DOCUMENTATION-INDEX.md, MAX-SETUP-GUIDE.md, claude.md, claude-chat-notes.md, delete/ folder, readme.md.txt

### Key Decisions
1. **Sessions.md** is primary session tracking (not tasks.md) - user request
2. **Root directory** for Sessions.md for easy access (user emphasized this)
3. **Technical vs Planning** separation for clear organization
4. **INDEX.md** for fast navigation instead of multiple entry points
5. **Consolidated README** instead of START-HERE/MANIFEST/QUICK-REFERENCE
