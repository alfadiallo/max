## üìä Overall Timeline

| Phase | Week | Focus | Hours | Status |
|-------|------|-------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Oct 28 - Nov 3 | Foundation | 25-35 | ‚è≥ Planned |
| 2 | Nov 4 - Nov 10 | Transcription | 25-35 | ‚è≥ Planned |
| 3 | Nov 11 - Nov 17 | Translation | 25-35 | ‚è≥ Planned |
| 4 | Nov 18 - Nov 24 | Summaries | 20-30 | ‚è≥ Planned |
| 5 | Nov 24 - Nov 25 | Deploy | 15-20 | ‚è≥ Planned |
| **Total** | **4 weeks** | **MVP** | **110-155 hours** | **‚è≥ Planning** |

## üéØ Priority Levels

### P0 - Critical (Must Have)
- Authentication
- Project management
- Audio upload
- Whisper transcription
- Editing & versioning
- Basic dashboard

### P1 - High (Should Have)
- Dictionary management
- Claude translation
- Summary generation
- Settings pages

### P2 - Medium (Nice to Have)
- UI polish
- Advanced features
- Performance optimization

---

## üö¶ Risk Management

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Whisper API integration** - New API, complex transcription format
2. **Claude prompt engineering** - Quality depends on prompts
3. **Versioning system** - Complex diff logic
4. **Multi-language support** - 8 languages is extensive

### Mitigation
- Start with Whisper early (Week 2)
- Test Claude prompts thoroughly
- Build versioning incrementally
- Validate with single language first
