2. All 5 workflows tested
3. No TypeScript errors
4. Performance acceptable
5. Error handling complete

---

## üö® Emergency Procedures

### If Something Goes Wrong
1. **Don't panic** - Document the error in `### Blockers`
2. **Check logs** - Browser console, server terminal, Supabase logs
3. **Isolate issue** - Which component/API is failing?
4. **Search documentation** - Check MAX-QUICK-START.md troubleshooting
5. **Ask Claude** - Use claude.md as reference, include error details
6. **Rollback if needed** - Git checkout to last working state

### If Behind Schedule
1. Cut non-critical features (P2, P3 items)
2. Focus on P0 items only
3. Deploy with reduced scope if necessary
4. Plan post-launch improvements

### If External API Down (Whisper/Claude)
1. Mock API responses for testing
2. Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
3. Cache responses for repeated calls
4. Notify user of rate limiting gracefully

3. **Document blockers early** - Let them be visible
4. **Read error messages carefully** - They usually tell you what's wrong
5. **Use React DevTools** - Inspect component state during debugging
6. **Reference documentation often** - You have 130 pages to work with
7. **Keep console clean** - Don't ship with console.log() calls
8. **Ask for help early** - Use claude.md if stuck >15 minutes
9. **Celebrate wins** - Each completed session is progress!
10. **Sleep well** - Tired devs make mistakes
